        <p>For this project, we designed a Graphical Password Authentication System. This is used to increase the protection/security of a website. Our system is divided into further 4 layers of protection. Each layer is totally different and diverse than the others. This not only increases protection, but also makes sure that no non-human can log in to your account using different activities such as Brute Force Algorithm and so on.</p>
